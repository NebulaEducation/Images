                <h2>Microcontroller</h2>
                <p>At the heart of your kit is a microcontroller. Using the same technology as the popular Arduino Uno, your microcontroller is perfect for testing and applying what you learn!</p>

                <h2>Breadboard</h2>
                <p>Breadboards are a great tool to prototype and buid circuits. Using the breadboard, you'll be able to build and improve all the circuits you create!</p>

                <h2>LED Lights</h2>
                <p>Using LED lights you'll learn how diodes can change the way charge flows through a circuit. Then, you'll be able to build a number of awesome projects with them!</p>
